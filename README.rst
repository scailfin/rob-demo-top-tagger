About
=====

The **Top Tagger Demo** is part of the `Reproducible Open Benchmarks for Data Analysis Platform (ROB) <https://github.com/scailfin/rob-core>`_. This demo contains part of the code used for the comparison analysis published in  `The Machine Learning Landscape of Top Taggers <https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09914>`_:

*"Based on the established task of identifying boosted, hadronically decaying top quarks, we compare a wide range of modern machine learning approaches. We find that they are extremely powerful and great fun."*

The majority of the code in this repository has been adopted from the following repositories: `Tree Network in Network (TreeNiN) for Jet Physics <https://github.com/SebastianMacaluso/TreeNiN>`_ and `Top Tagging Comparison Analysis <https://github.com/SebastianMacaluso/TopTagComparison>`_.
